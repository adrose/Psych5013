# Question 2

## a.

The numerator degrees of freedom is: 19

The denonminator degrees of freedom is: 3

KJHFIUEHWEKJENHFIOU$HF(&$RY)

## b. 

The n for this model was: 26

## c. 

The root MSE is: 10.28945

This value reflects the conditional standard deviation, or the standard deviation of the residual values.

## d.

The dependent variables mean value is: 61.34783

## e.

The best estimate for the PRE is 0.6210; this is the PRE when taking in to account the number of variables used to train the model.

## f.

The value of the intercept term is 162.87590

This value reflects the predicted outcome when all independent variables are 0.

## g.

The variable with the greatest predictive influence when accounting for covariates is x3

This can be observed in various ways, perhaps the most convincing is the t value, which is the largest t value for any predictor other than the intercept, furthermore the standardaized coefficeint is also the largest, suggesting the strongest conditioned relationship exists between the DV and x3.

## h.

A parameter estimate reflects the change in the DV in one unit change of the IV.

For instance, using the raw coefficients, as x3 changes from 3 to 4; there is a decrease in y of -1.21032 units.

## i. 

# Question 3

Model DF: 3

Model Sum of Squares: `r (9.1226852 * qf(0.998, df1=3, df2=18)) * 3`

Model Mean Square: `r 9.1226852 * qf(0.998, df1=3, df2=18)`

Model F value: `r qf(0.998, df1=3, df2=18)`

Error DF: 18

Error Sum of Squares: `r 489.8181818 - (9.1226852 * qf(0.998, df1=3, df2=18))`
